# RentHub

Renting rooms and flats, moving and settling to new places, meeting the essentials for being an owner or tenant has always been a major difficulty in city areas. There is a demand of a way that can connect every user. 
RentHub system helps in early finding of house that best fits user requirements. System only allows interaction with opposite party. If a user logged in to system as a tenant, he/she will only be seeing posts from owners. 
That user will only be connecting with owners. In-app chat system helps users in keeping their privacy safe by not sharing their other social communication mediums to an unknown person. 
With the access of internet, we can post our problems virtually on a right platform from where we can find out the solutions. 
The problem that requires a week or even a month can be easily solve just in a day.

The system will only allow user to view content after they are logged in. They can choose
either google registration or manual registration. The email provided while registering will
get a verification link to verify account. Unverified account cannot login to system. If the
user forget password, they can change it by providing their registered email. Then the
email will receive a reset password link to reset password. Every user will have user type.
They can only view, save posts from opposite type of user. Only tenants can book a post
if the post is not booked. User will have full access to create post and update, hide/show,
delete their posts. Quick search with multiple fields is on home page. Users can comment
to posts and in bottom of the post detail page there is a recommended post. There is inapp chat system for users. User can only create chat connection and send messages to
opposite type of user.
